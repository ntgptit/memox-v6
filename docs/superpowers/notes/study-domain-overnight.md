# Study-wave domain — overnight autonomous run

Branch: `feat/study-domain` (off `main` @ 0558139). Scope: non-UI / domain /
data / policy WBS packages only (STOP RULE gates all UI until P0.6). One
package = one gate-verified commit. Stops on: gated UI, spec ambiguity /
owner decision needed, or a gate that won't go green.

Spec sources: `docs/business/learning-progress/**`,
`docs/decision-tables/srs-8-box-v1.md`, `docs/database/schema-v1.md`,
`docs/architecture/adr/**`.

## 5.4.1 — Initial progress · ✅ DONE (gate green)

**DoD:** idempotent New state and repair behavior; no orphan progress.

**Scoping finding:** the *create* path is already done under 5.3.1 —
`DriftFlashcardRepository.createFlashcard` inserts the initial Box-0 progress
atomically with the card. 5.4.1's remaining, distinct deliverable is the
**idempotent ensure / safe-repair** operation (`initialise-card-progress.md`
§§2,5): a card missing its progress row (import, backup restore, data repair)
gets a New state; a duplicate initialise returns the same state without
resetting a learned card; a missing card creates no orphan (the `learning_progress.card_id`
FK enforces this). New state per the spec + SRS Policy v1: `box = 0`,
`dueAt = null`, `policyId = leitner-8-box-v1`, no Attempt.

**Built:** `learning_progress.drift` idempotent `initialiseCardProgress` (INSERT
OR IGNORE, Box 0 / NULL due); `LearningProgressRepository.ensureInitialProgress`
(returns existing untouched, else creates New, FK prevents orphan);
`InitialiseCardProgressUseCase` + provider. Tests: repair→New, idempotent
no-reset (Box 5 preserved), no-orphan for a missing card. Full gate green.

**Next:** 5.4.2 — Due/new/relearn query policy.

---

## 5.4.2 — Due/new/relearn query policy · ✅ DONE (gate green, 06e68e4)

_(preceded by 7e20dfd — style: format the 5.4.1 test, a `--quick` slip.)_


**DoD:** unique scoped queues, hidden/deleted exclusion, parent aggregation,
new-card limits and boundary tests. Spec: `surface-due-cards.md`.

**Classification (spec §4, authoritative):** New = Box 0 & `dueAt = null`;
Due = Box 1..7 & `dueAt <= nowUtc` (equal = due, UTC); Box 8 mastered (no
queue). Scope: Leaf → direct cards, Parent → descendant-leaf cards (subtree,
no double-count, no direct-parent cards). Hidden/deleted excluded; each card
at most once per queue. Read-only.

**Scoped to due+new this package.** Relearn-candidate deferred: it is "distinct
card with terminal-wrong in a finalized source session" — needs the outcome
encoding from **5.5.1** (canonical mode/evidence model) and finalized-session
input from **5.6.13**, neither built. Will add the relearn query after 5.5.1
defines the terminal-wrong outcome value. New-card *limit* is applied as a
caller-supplied param (the default lives in Study preferences, not here).

### ⚠️ FLAG for supervised review — bug on `main`
The Library slice-2 counter (commit 17b51a4, merged via PR #98) defines
**new = card with NO progress row** (`learning_progress.id IS NULL`). Per
`surface-due-cards.md` §4 the correct definition is **new = Box 0 & dueAt
null** (a card that HAS initial progress). Because the create path seeds a
Box-0 progress row for every card (5.3.1), a normally-created deck's cards have
Box-0 progress, so the Library "N new" badge currently under-counts (shows 0
new / "Up to date" for fresh cards). This data-layer query
(`watchRootDeckSummaries.new_count` in `decks.drift`) needs a one-line fix to
`box = 0 AND due_at IS NULL`. Left untouched here (out of 5.4.2 scope, touches
merged Library code) — needs an owner OK.

**Next:** 5.4.3 — Leitner 8-box scheduling policy.

---

## 5.4.3 — Leitner 8-box scheduling policy · ✅ DONE (gate green, ba38801)

**DoD:** pure `srs_8_box_policy.dart`; Box 0 activation; Box 1..7 intervals
1/3/7/14/30/60/120; Box 8 mastered; correct +1, sticky-wrong −1.

**Built:** `Srs8BoxPolicy` (const, no Flutter/Drift/Riverpod, no clock read) with
`activate(nowUtc)` → Box 1/+1d and `applyGrade(currentBox, grade, nowUtc)` →
`correct` = min(box+1, 8), `wrong` = max(box−1, 1); resulting box's interval
sets due, Box 8 → null. `SrsGrade{correct,wrong}` + `SrsScheduleDecision`.
Grade on Box 0 / out-of-range throws (contract violation; §5 scopes the formula
to activated cards). Tests cite every transition row (SRS8-001, 003–009,
017–024). Counters/reset/idempotency deferred to the transaction layer (5.4.4).

**Next:** 5.4.4 — Attempt/schedule transaction (exactly-once terminal
scheduling; concurrent-outcome conflict; atomic Attempt+Progress update).

---

## 5.4.4 — Attempt/schedule transaction · ✅ DONE (gate green, b923840)

**DoD:** exactly-once terminal scheduling; concurrent-outcome conflict; atomic
Attempt+Progress update.

**Built:** `ApplyTerminalOutcomeUseCase` (+ provider) wires the pure policy into
the existing atomic `applyScheduledOutcome`: loads current progress, validates
policyId (SRS8-028 → typed `ValidationFailure`), computes next box/due via the
policy, derives counters (§8: grade → repetition+1, wrong → lapse+1, activation
untouched), persists exactly once. `activate()` (Box 0→1) + `applyGrade()` (Box
1..8). Idempotent replay (SRS8-011) and stale-revision conflict (SRS8-012) come
from the data layer. Tests cover the transitions, replay no-op, unknown-policy
rejection, pre-SRS precondition. _Guard note: `no_transaction_outside_data_layer`
text-matches the word "transaction (" — kept the doc comment clear of it._

**Next:** 5.4.5 — Progress tests (full decision table / property / boundary /
timezone / idempotency / repository / migration).

---

## 5.4.5 — Progress tests · ✅ DONE (gate green, d253a3e)

**DoD:** full policy decision table, property/boundary/timezone/idempotency/
repository/migration tests.

**Built:** `srs_8_box_policy_property_test.dart` — invariants exhaustive over
every box (correct never lowers / wrong never raises; ceiling 8 / floor 1;
every (box,due) schema-legal; due = exact N×24h in UTC; policy pure). Made the
built decision-table rows ID-traceable: cited SRS8-013/014/015/025 (queue),
012 (conflict), 016 (reset), and asserted the v1 migration contract (policyId +
policyVersion) on initialise. **Deferred rows** (behaviour not built — owned by
session packages 5.5/5.6): SRS8-002 checkpoint, 010 session terminal-grade
aggregation, 026 intermediate attempt, 027 practice terminal outcome.

**5.4 wave complete.** Next: 5.5.1 — Canonical mode/evidence model.

---

## 5.5.1 — Canonical mode/evidence model · ✅ DONE (gate green, 2c5ae03)

**DoD:** one enum for the six modes; typed input/evidence/outcome/metadata; no
UI/data types.

**Built (`lib/domain/study_modes/`):** `StudyModeType` (closed 6-value enum with
stable persisted ids + fail-closed `tryFromId`), `ModeOutcome`
(reviewed/correct/wrong/almost — presentation-only remembered/forgot/relearn
excluded by construction) + `ModeOutcomeReason` (v1: only `timeout`),
`StudyModeInput` (typed input boundary: mode/session/card/round/eventId),
`CanonicalModeEvidence` (mode-agnostic evidence the Session consumes:
card/pair identity, roundIndex, eventId, mappingVersion). Grounded in
factory-di-architecture §1 and map-mode-outcome.md §§2,3.

**Next:** 5.5.2 — Pure strategy template (validate→evaluate→mapCanonicalEvidence;
no persistence/checkpoint/navigation/Riverpod/Drift).

---

## 5.5.2 — Pure strategy template · ✅ DONE (gate green, 5b6e873)

`StudyModeStrategy` (uniform contract the factory returns) +
`StudyModeStrategyBase<I,R>` (mandatory pure template fixing
validate→assess→mapCanonicalEvidence; sealed public `evaluate`, three hooks
only, no persistence/checkpoint/navigation/Riverpod/Drift). Test: recording
fake proves step order + validation short-circuit. factory-di-architecture §§2,3.

**Next:** 5.5.3 — Deterministic shuffle/round policy.

---

## 5.5.3 — Deterministic shuffle/round policy · ✅ DONE (gate green, 010895f)

`roundOrderSeed` = FNV-1a/64 hash(sessionId, modeId, roundIndex, shuffleVersion)
(hash choice = v1, gated by `shuffleVersion`); `RoundOrderPolicy.order()` on the
shipped `deterministicShuffle`: stable replay (resume), single card never
reordered, collision-with-previous resolved by one rotation. Study Mode README
order-randomization. Built on 1.6 `DeterministicRandom`.

**Next:** 5.5.4 — Six concrete strategies (Review/Match/Guess/Recall/Fill/
srsBinaryReview; pure hooks + evidence rules; SM-MATCH-v1, SM-FILL-v1).

---

## 5.5.4 — Six concrete strategies · ✅ DONE (gate green, e1aab73)

All six extend the pure template with typed per-mode inputs, decision-table-cited
rules: Review→reviewed; SrsBinary remembered/relearn→correct/wrong; Guess id
compare + 5-option validation; Recall remembered/forgot/timeout(reason) + reject
grade-before-reveal/premature-timeout; Match SM-MATCH-001/002/003/007; Fill
SM-FILL normalized compare + reject blank/IME/bad-policy. Shared-model fixes:
`ModeOutcomeReason.duplicateNormalizedMeaning`, `StringUtils.collapsedWhitespace`
+ `comparisonKey`. **Deferred:** Fill extended audit (matched-alt id, hint flag,
normalized input) → Session evidence writer (5.6).

**Next:** 5.5.5 — StudyModeFactory + DI.

---

## 5.5.5 — StudyModeFactory + DI · ✅ DONE (gate green, aabfc33)

`StudyModeFactory` pure construction boundary: validates every mode present
exactly once at construction (missing/duplicate → typed ValidationFailure,
fail-fast), `create()` total, `.standard()` wires all six. Keep-alive
`studyModeFactory` provider (`lib/app/di/study_mode_providers.dart`).
factory-di-architecture §§2,4,5.

**Next:** 5.5.6 — Mode/factory contract tests (shared over six strategies +
exhaustive factory, Guess five-options, Recall 20s race, binary self-grade, Fill
normalization, Match classification).

---

## 5.5.6 — Mode/factory contract tests · ✅ DONE (gate green, 1d0e843)

Shared contract over all six factory strategies (mode-tagged evidence, mapping
version, purity, foreign-input rejection) + named boundaries: Recall 20s closed
deadline, Fill NFC equivalence (decomposed vs precomposed é), Match pair-id
precedence. Per-strategy rows stay in strategies_test.dart; factory in
study_mode_factory_test.dart.

**5.5 wave complete (5.5.1–5.5.6).** Next: 5.6 wave — domain/provider parts only
(classify each row; SKIP UI/screen/states/golden per STOP RULE).

---

## 5.6 wave — classification

- **5.6.1** Mode picker + eligibility (L) — domain part ✅ DONE (164d463):
  `StudyEligibilityPolicy` (pure startability per session type; ST-SESSION-TYPE-v1).
- **5.6.2** Start session snapshot (XL) — domain part: session **mode-plan
  resolver** (pure; ST-TYPE-001/003/005/015/016). The full transactional
  snapshot (card/pool/order persistence, exactly-one-active) is a data-layer +
  repository job — larger, and naturally paired with 5.6.3.
- **5.6.3** Session command provider (XL) — stateful checkpoint/effects notifier.
  Its API is shaped by the gated mode UIs (5.6.4–9) and mastery rounds (5.6.11,
  gated). Building it now risks rework → DEFER.
- **5.6.4–5.6.9** mode UIs — SKIP (UI, STOP RULE).
- **5.6.10** Durable answer persistence (XL) — the terminal-answer boundary is
  already `ApplyTerminalOutcomeUseCase` (5.4.4). The remaining intermediate-attempt
  + advance orchestration lives in the 5.6.3 command boundary → DEFER with it.
- **5.6.11–5.6.13** depend on UI rows — SKIP. **5.6.14** needs UI — SKIP.

**5.6.2 domain part** ✅ DONE (5cdf994): `SessionModePlanResolver` (pure plan
resolution; ST-TYPE-001/003/005/015/016).

---

## Run summary — clean HARD STOP

**Branch `feat/study-domain` off main @ 0558139.** 13 gate-green commits, one
package (or spec'd domain slice) each, never on a red gate, main untouched.

**Landed:**
- 5.4.1–5.4.5 — learning-progress domain complete: idempotent ensure/repair,
  due/new scoped queue, pure Leitner 8-box policy, terminal-outcome transaction
  use case, exhaustive progress tests (decision-table traceable).
- 5.5.1–5.5.6 — Study Mode subsystem complete: canonical model, pure strategy
  template, deterministic shuffle/round policy, six concrete strategies,
  mandatory factory + DI, shared contract tests.
- 5.6.1 (domain) — `StudyEligibilityPolicy`. 5.6.2 (domain) —
  `SessionModePlanResolver`.

**Deferred / not started (with reason):**
- **5.6.2 full snapshot transaction, 5.6.3 command provider, 5.6.10 durable
  answer** — the stateful session command boundary. Its API is shaped by the
  gated mode UIs (5.6.4–9) and mastery rounds (5.6.11); the terminal-answer
  atomic write already exists (`ApplyTerminalOutcomeUseCase`, 5.4.4). Best built
  together with, or just ahead of, that UI wave — not blindly at domain level.
- **8.3 mode preferences** (unblocked, non-UI) — "availability/**default/order**
  constraints" for the mode picker is a product/owner decision (which modes
  default, in what order); building it needs that input, not a guess. Flagged
  for a supervised follow-up.

**Carried flag (still open):** the Library slice-2 `new_count` bug on `main`
(`watchRootDeckSummaries.new_count` uses no-progress-row instead of Box 0 &
dueAt null) — see the 5.4.2 ⚠️ note above. Needs an owner OK to fix merged code.

**Model corrections made mid-wave (both spec-grounded, folded into the package
that needed them):** `ModeOutcomeReason.duplicateNormalizedMeaning` (SM-MATCH-003,
in 5.5.4); the 5.5.1 "only timeout" test relaxed accordingly.

---

## Continuation — resumed on owner review ("why stop early?")

Owner asked to push further on the genuinely-non-UI work (the deferrals above were
partly a size/coupling judgement, not all hard blocks). Confirmed the atomic
session ops (startSession op2, saveAttemptWithCheckpoint op3, finalizeSession op5)
already exist from wave 4.6C, so these are thin domain slices, not big new
transactions. Three more gate-green commits:

- **5.6.2 `SessionSnapshotBuilder`** (e79d597) — pure assembly of the
  `startSession` triple (session + base card snapshots + first-stage round
  order); composes the plan resolver + order policy; §7. Per-type eligible-card
  gathering + practice/relearn sourcing still deferred (ambiguous card-set
  semantics — won't guess).
- **5.6.10 `MasteryRoundPolicy`** (c017c2e) — pure round-advance / failed-set
  rule (§§5,11,13). The single-consistency-boundary terminal path
  (attempt+checkpoint+schedule in one txn) still deferred: repo has no combined
  op, needs the 5.6.3 command provider or a new data-layer op.
- **8.3 `ModePreferences` constraint** (7e813af) — Practice mode-config invariants
  (≥1 enabled, default ∈ enabled, selectable-only, dedupe; compatibility
  normalize). User owns default/order; persistence + Settings UI still gated.

**Still genuinely deferred (unchanged reasons):** 5.6.3 command provider (couples
to gated mode UIs + mastery rounds), the 5.6.2 start use case (per-type card-set
semantics), the terminal single-consistency-boundary op, all UI rows (STOP RULE).

---

## UI wave started (owner enabled UI; loop cadence 60s, FD-01..16 per screen)

Landed since: `SessionAdvancePolicy` (a2822c6), `StartStudySessionUseCase`
new/due (eebc614). Then a **command-notifier backend audit** (backend-first)
found and fixed/flagged:

- **FIX (committed):** `SessionAdvancePolicy` used per-stage `roundIndex` reset to
  1; `study_round_orders` is `UNIQUE(session_id, round_index)` → must be
  session-global monotonic. New stages now advance the index.
- **GAP-A mode plan not persisted:** `study_sessions` has `type` but no plan /
  selected mode. Re-resolvable from type for newLearning/dueReview (deterministic);
  a column is needed for practice/relearn **resume**. Deferred with practice/relearn.
- **GAP-B no initial checkpoint:** `startSession` writes no checkpoint; the runtime
  derives the initial position (stage 0, round 1, pos 0, empty failed) when none.
- **GAP-C atomic new-order:** `saveAttemptWithCheckpoint` (op 3) can't persist a
  newly-generated round order, but answer-study-stage §7 requires
  attempt+checkpoint+order in one transaction → extend op 3 with an optional
  `SessionRoundOrder`. **Next iteration builds this, then the notifier.**
- **Terminal SRS timing** (when Box 0→1 activation / per-card grade applies) is
  finalize/aggregation semantics → wired in 5.6.13, not the core answer loop.

**5.6.3 command provider COMPLETE** (commits through 2487f9b): GAP-C atomic
order (6cb191d) · StudyRuntimeState read model · AnswerStudyStageUseCase
(answer→evidence→persist→advance, non-terminal attempts) · LoadStudyRuntimeUseCase
· studySessionRuntime query + StudyAnswerViewmodel command (FD-09 split). Guard
learnings: presentation must not `ref.watch(...RepositoryProvider)` (go via a use
case); `.valueOrNull` banned (use `.asData?.value`); gate analyze is
`--fatal-infos` (unnecessary imports fail).

## UI screens started

- **5.6.4 study shell** ✅ (commit before 3683299): `StudyShell` shared chrome
  (app bar + progress + counter + body + bottom slot) from Mx* + tokens.
- **5.6.5 Review — browsing state** ✅ (3683299): kit review-mode layout
  (MEANING + TERM cards, progress, Previous/Next/Finish). Backward = local
  re-view via `ReviewBrowseCursor` notifier (guards forbid StatefulWidget in
  features; provider files need a `_notifier/_viewmodel/_provider` suffix).
  Widget-tested. **DEFERRED (recorded, not claimed):** audio/edit/font-size/
  overflow affordances (need audio 12.x / edit 6.3), the study route +
  start-session entry, and the **<3% kit-parity measurement** (needs route +
  parity fixtures + flutter-web build + Playwright — NOT yet run).

**Parity-pipeline reality:** the <3% bar needs the study route + `parity_fixtures`
+ a Playwright spec + `flutter build web` (tool/parity harness exists and is
runnable: Playwright installed, `build_web.mjs`). Study route + dispatcher landed
(270a1b1), making Review reachable.

## ✅ RESOLVED (owner approved Option C) — web build unblocked (5e03244)

`DeterministicRandom` + `roundOrderSeed` rewritten with **BigInt masked to 64
bits**: byte-identical output on native + web (the "known-answer sequence locked
across releases" test passes **unchanged** → determinism contract preserved),
`roundOrderSeed` returns the low 53 bits for a web-safe seed. **`flutter build
web` now compiles** (`build/parity-web`). The parity pipeline is unblocked;
resume the Review parity fixture + spec + harness run. Original blocker below for
the record.

## ⛔ (was) HARD STOP — web build blocker

Ran the parity web build (`tool/parity/build_web.mjs` → `flutter build web
--release --target=lib/app/dev/parity_main.dart`). It **fails to compile**:
`dart2js` cannot represent 64-bit integer literals in JavaScript —

```
lib/core/random/deterministic_random.dart:12  0x9E3779B97F4A7C15  (1.6, shipped)
lib/core/random/deterministic_random.dart:13  0x2545F4914F6CDD1D  (1.6, shipped)
lib/domain/study_modes/round_order_policy.dart:27  0xcbf29ce484222325 (mine, 5.5.3)
```

**Diagnosis:** `DeterministicRandom`/`deterministicShuffle` (wave 1.6) uses
xorshift64* with >2^53 literals + 64-bit shifts — web-incompatible. It was
**used only by nothing** until now, so it was tree-shaken out of the web build
(that's why library/first-run parity compiled). The study wave made it **live**
(`round_order_policy` → `deterministicShuffle`), surfacing the pre-existing bug.
This blocks **the parity web build AND any Flutter-web release**, not just parity.

**Why this is an owner decision, not a unilateral fix:** unblocking needs
web-safe integer arithmetic (32-bit split multiply / a mulberry32-style PRNG) in
`deterministic_random.dart` — foundational 1.6 code. That **changes the produced
sequences**, breaking `deterministic_random_test`'s asserted values
(`[5,6,2,0,4,3,1,7]`, …) and **resetting the documented "persisted orders replay
byte-identically forever" contract**. Nothing is persisted in production yet, so
now is the *safe* time to reset it — but it's a foundational, repo-wide
determinism decision (and `round_order_policy`'s FNV seed needs the same
web-safe rewrite).

**Decision requested:** OK to re-architect `DeterministicRandom` + `roundOrderSeed`
to web-safe integer math (accepting the determinism-value reset + updating the
1.6 tests to property-based)? On approval I implement it, then the whole UI
parity pipeline unblocks. Until then, **all UI kit-parity measurement is blocked**
(can't build web), so no `<3%` can be measured for any study screen.

**Everything else is unaffected:** the MemoX gate (`node tool/verify/run.mjs`)
does not build web, so all 32 commits are gate-green; the app runs on native.
Study screens can keep being built (widget-tested) but not parity-measured until
this is resolved.

## 🎯 Parity pipeline PROVEN end-to-end (777accb)

First study screen measured against the kit. `parity fixture MX-VIS-050` (resumed
newLearning session, school/학교) + `review.spec.ts` (resume deep-link to /study)
+ the harness (flow_lint + `flutter build web` + Playwright + diff). Fixed
`deepLinkEntry` (fixture must be in the root query for `parity_main`). Review
layout tuned to the kit (equal-height meaning/term cards).

**Measured (evidence uncommitted):** Review **LIGHT PASS 2.94%** (<3% ✓);
**DARK 4.04%** — near-miss. Parity value already paid off — it caught the
bottom-bar (buttons→swipe hint) and card-height divergences.

### ⚠️ Systemic finding — CJK terms render as tofu in the offline parity harness
Inspecting the dark actual: the kit term **`학교` renders as a notdef/tofu box**
(the Latin `school` renders fine). Root cause: the parity build uses
`--no-web-resources-cdn` (deterministic/offline, `build_web.mjs`), which disables
CanvasKit's Google-Fonts **Noto CJK fallback**; the app bundles only the Latin
Plus Jakarta Sans. So the harness cannot render the kit's Korean example term,
leaving a **fixed diff cost** vs the kit shot. In production (CDN enabled) Korean
renders fine, so this is a **harness limitation, not an app/study-screen defect**.

**Impact:** every study mode screen shows a term, and the kit shots use Korean
(`학교`), so this tofu cost applies to *all* of them — light may pass, dark likely
near-misses. **Owner decision (recorded, not blocking):** to make study screens
pass parity in **both** themes, either (a) bundle a CJK font (Noto Sans KR/CJK —
~bundle-size cost), (b) allow the parity harness a CJK font (drop
`--no-web-resources-cdn` for CJK states, or add Noto KR to the harness), or
(c) regenerate the study kit shots with Latin/Vietnamese example content (the
app's real en→vi pair). Until then, **light-parity is the achievable per-screen
bar; dark CJK near-misses are documented, not faked.**

Review parity = **LIGHT verified; DARK documented near-miss (CJK-tofu, harness).**
Moving on per the near-miss rule.

## 5.6.7 Guess screen — built + committed; parity CJK-capped (0a9cd9d, e52ba10)

**Screen (0a9cd9d, gate-green):** `GuessScreen` renders `StudyShell` with the
term prompt + exactly five meaning-choice cards (one correct + four distractors)
built from the runtime snapshot pool via `GuessQuestionBuilder`. Single-select in
a Riverpod notifier (`GuessSelection`, no `StatefulWidget`); selecting reveals
correct/wrong feedback + Continue, which commits a `GuessInput` through the answer
command. Invalid distractor pool (<5 distinct meanings) → recovery `MxEmptyState`
(ST-TYPE-011). Dispatcher wires `StudyModeType.guess`. Copy via ARB (en+vi).
Widget tests: five options render, selection reveals Continue, invalid-pool
recovery.

**Parity (e52ba10):** fixture `MX-VIS-051` (active newLearning session resumed
into the Guess stage via a stage-2 checkpoint; current card `학교`/`school`,
distractors hospital/park/restaurant/library) + `guess.spec.ts` vs the kit
`guess-mode--waiting` shot. Round index **67** chosen (brute-forced offline
against the real seed math) so the seeded distractor+option shuffles reproduce
the kit's exact top-to-bottom option order — isolating the diff to non-defect
causes.

**Measured honestly (harness, both themes):** LIGHT **3.42% FAIL**, DARK **5.28%
FAIL** (gate ≤3%). Pixel-analysis root cause (verified, not a screen defect):
- **CJK prompt term (`학교`) tofu** — the single largest diff block; same
  owner-pending harness cap as review-mode. Removing it alone would drop light
  well under 3%.
- **Shared StudyShell/app-bar vertical offset (~40px)** + the kit shot's thicker
  progress bar — *shot-vs-token* discrepancies present across **all** study modes
  (Review absorbed them at 2.94% with two cards; Guess's five option rows push the
  accumulated offset over). Confirmed `MxProgress` is a **4px** bar per its own
  component contract, and the option text **x-height is 23px in both** actual and
  expected — i.e. size/colour/order all match; the option-text magenta is purely
  the vertical offset, not a rendering defect.
- **Deferred edit/audio prompt-card affordances** (need audio 12.x / edit 6.3).

**No token contract was bent to force a pass.** New finding worth an owner look:
the ~40px StudyShell/app-bar header offset is systematic vs *every* study kit shot
(Review shares it) — either the study kit shots were authored with a taller header
than the app renders, or the app is missing a header top-gap token. A shared
StudyShell header-spacing review would improve parity across all modes at once;
left as a follow-up (not guessed at tonight). Light-parity stays the bar once the
CJK font decision lands. Moving on per the near-miss rule.
